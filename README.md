# NBA-Playoff-Result-Classification

For this project, I used Hollinger's NBA Statistics to test the validity of K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting for predicting the playoff outcome of an NBA Team. All coding and exploratory data analysis was done in Python, utlizing Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit Learn. A full description of the project and its results can be seen in the uploaded .docx file.
